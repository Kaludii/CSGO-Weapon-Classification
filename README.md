# CSGO Weapon Image Classification

This is a machine learning model developed by Kaludi that can classify 11 different types of weapons in the popular game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO). The model is capable of accurately classifying the weapon present in an image. With its deep understanding of the characteristics of each weapon in the game, the model is a valuable tool for players and fans of CSGO.

## Model & Dataset Info

The model was trained on the [CSGO Weapon Image Classification dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Kaludi/data-csgo-weapon-classification) and the model is available on HuggingFace [here](https://huggingface.co/Kaludi/csgo-weapon-classification).

## Getting started

You can use this model by installing the required packages and running the code provided in the python code cell above. The model is available via the HuggingFace Transformers library and can be used in your own projects as well.

## Model Details

The model was trained using deep learning techniques and state-of-the-art architectures for image classification. The model was trained to recognize 11 different weapons in CSGO. The 11 weapons are:

-   AK-47
-   AWP
-   Famas
-   Galil-AR
-   Glock
-   M4A1
-   M4A4
-   P-90
-   SG-553
-   UMP
-   USP

## Example Usage

You can test the model using the example images provided in the code or by using your own images. Simply run the code and use the Gradio interface to upload an image of a weapon from CSGO. The model will then classify the weapon present in the image and display the result.

## How to Use

1.  Clone or download the repository.
2.  Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.  Run the script using `python app.py`.
4.  Input a customer review in the textbox and click on "Run".
5.  The output will show the sentiment prediction of the review as either Positive or Negative along with the respective confidence score.
